# fylo-theme-front-end-challenge


Hey, hello! This is my attempt to complete Frontend Mentor's Fylo challenge. It's also my very first entry to Github as I start my journey into web dev. I've been studying HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the past four weeks and I felt this was a great challenge to take on in order to apply the concepts I learned while watching tutorials and online courses so far.
